# Custom UIScales

Rimworld Mod to allow any custom UI Scale you like, over the 9 provided in the base game.
Simply open up the mod settings, type in a custom size and away you go.

Note that if you manage to do something weird like make the UI so small you can't see it, simply deleting the config file from:
`%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config` will reset it.
